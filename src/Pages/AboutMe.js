       <h2 className="aboutTitle">About me</h2>
        <p>I am a Front-End Software Engineer with a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and a love for problem solving. I grew up helping my parents farm and sell vegetables up until I finished college. My original plan was to become a math instructor but when covid hit, I saw that it wouldâ€™ve been a difficult time to pursue that career. While in isolation, life came and gave me presented an opportunity to me so I applied for General Assembly, a coding camp. During the bootcamp I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript, React and Express.</p>
